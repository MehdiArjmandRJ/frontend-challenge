# My Description For Task

    Hello Good day
    The test task is almost done
    I need to explain some issues.
    I used HttpContext for loading management, but because I didn't have any api, I just wrote the code, but it was not used in this project.
    Regarding the recipes and my recipes pages, it was my mistake to separate these two pages and because I used lazy loading, the table value is reset.But I implemented the actions on these pages.
    In the sample project, I also put codes separate from the task that I usually use.

    Like autocomplete, because it was a static task, I could not use these items.
    I also handled the loading of the buttons in the component, as you can see in the review.
    I wrote the error handling code, but because the task is static, I did not use it.
    I hope my effort is close to your standards.
